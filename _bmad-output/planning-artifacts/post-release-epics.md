# Post-v0.1.0 Epic Plan

The first provider version is published. Completed post-release work closed the original data-source parity, Registry docs, verified gap, and HAProxy/ACME migration tracks. The next management focus is release-gated OPNsense assignment API adoption, complete coverage positioning, and v1 credibility.

## Epic 25B: Data Source Parity

Goal: close straightforward data-source parity gaps and leave only singleton or sensitive special-case follow-up work. Epic 25B completed the move from 34 to 76 supported data sources, leaving 15 resource-matching data-source gaps.

| Story | Status | File |
|---|---|---|
| 25B.1 Data Source Parity Inventory and Implementation Batches | done | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/25b-1-data-source-parity-inventory-and-batches.md` |
| 25B.2 High-Reference Data Sources | done | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/25b-2-high-reference-data-sources.md` |
| 25B.3 Routing, DNS, DHCP, ACME, and Trust Data Sources | done | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/25b-3-routing-dns-dhcp-acme-trust-data-sources.md` |

## Epic 26: Registry Docs Hardening

Goal: improve the published Registry experience now that users can install the provider.

| Story | Status | File |
|---|---|---|
| 26.1 Published Registry Documentation Audit | done | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/26-1-registry-docs-audit.md` |
| 26.2 Public Support Matrix in Registry Docs | done | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/26-2-public-support-matrix-registry-docs.md` |
| 26.3 Full-Appliance Migration and Import Guide | done | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/26-3-full-appliance-migration-guide.md` |

## Epic 27: Remaining Buildable Resource Gaps

Goal: verify and implement remaining provider-owned resource gaps without speculating on unconfirmed endpoints.

| Story | Status | File |
|---|---|---|
| 27.1 Verify Remaining Buildable Resource Gaps | done | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/27-1-verify-buildable-resource-gaps.md` |
| 27.2 Implement Highest-Value Verified Resource Gap | done | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/27-2-implement-highest-value-verified-gap.md` |
| 27.3 Implement OSPF Area Resource | done | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/27-3-implement-ospf-area-resource.md` |
| 27.4 HASync Configuration Model Review (no resource shipped) | done | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/27-4-implement-hasync-configuration-resource.md` |

## Epic 28: Upstream-Blocked Tracking

Goal: keep OPNsense-side blockers visible, honest, and periodically reviewed.

| Story | Status | File |
|---|---|---|
| 28.1 Upstream-Blocked Register and Maintenance Workflow | done | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/28-1-upstream-blocked-register-and-maintenance.md` |
| 28.2 Research HASync Status and Actions | done | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/28-2-research-hasync-status-actions.md` |
| 28.3 Research System Tunables and Sysctl API Lifecycle | done | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/28-3-research-system-tunables-sysctl.md` |
| 28.4 Implement System Tunables Resource | done | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/28-4-implement-system-tunables-resource.md` |

## Epic 29: Appliance Migration Blockers — HAProxy Routing, TLS & ACME Issuance

Goal: close the specific gaps that block migrating a real multi-domain OPNsense edge off Ansible onto this provider. Driven by the downstream `opnsense-manager` appliance, whose `https-in` frontend routes many domains (incl. CNAME aliases) via a domain map + actions, applies internal-only deny rules and an HTTP→HTTPS redirect, and binds an ACME-issued certificate. Verified missing/incomplete against **v0.2.0** source.

| Story | Status | File |
|---|---|---|
| 29.1 HAProxy Action Resource | done | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/29-1-haproxy-action-resource.md` |
| 29.2 HAProxy Map File Resource | done | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/29-2-haproxy-mapfile-resource.md` |
| 29.3 HAProxy Frontend TLS Certificate Binding | done | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/29-3-haproxy-frontend-tls-certificate-binding.md` |
| 29.4 ACME Certificate Issuance & Refid Output | done | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/29-4-acme-certificate-issuance-and-refid.md` |
| 29.5 ddclient Daemon Settings Resource | done | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/29-5-ddclient-daemon-settings-resource.md` |
| 29.6 Multi-Domain Edge Composition & Migration Validation | done | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/29-6-multi-domain-edge-composition-and-migration-validation.md` |

**Notes / corrections to prior tracking:**
- 29.1 / 29.2 / 29.3 were deferred in Story 4.2 ("What NOT to Build") to a Story 4.3 that only shipped ACLs — the action, map file, and frontend cert-binding were never created.
- 29.4 corrects Story 8.2: despite being titled "...with Issuance" and marked done, `certificate_resource.go` is plain CRUD (no `/sign`, no status poll, no refid output).
- 29.5 supersedes the wrongly-cancelled Story 9.5 — daemon settings (`enabled`/`daemon_delay`/`backend`/...) are a distinct `/dyndns/settings` object, not the account-level `service` field.
- **Out of scope (still blocked):** DHCP PXE/TFTP options remain in Stories 11.3 / 21.4 pending live Kea `dhcpv4 *_option` endpoint verification; a full appliance cutover keeps DHCP on Ansible until then.

**Recommended build order:** 29.1 → 29.2 → 29.4 → 29.3 → 29.5 (independent) → 29.6 (capstone). 29.3 wants 29.4's `cert_ref_id`; 29.6 depends on 29.1–29.4.

## Epic 30: OPNsense Assignment API Adoption

Goal: safely adopt the expanded upstream `api/interfaces/assignment/*` API after it lands in a stable OPNsense release. The September 2026 upstream PR detour proved the separate `address_settings` endpoint is not the right direction; provider work should consume the upstream assignment API instead.

| Story | Status | File |
|---|---|---|
| 30.1 Track OPNsense Assignment API Release | backlog | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/30-1-track-opnsense-assignment-api-release.md` |
| 30.2 Prototype Interface Assignment/IP Resource Against OPNsense Master | backlog | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/30-2-prototype-interface-assignment-ip-resource.md` |
| 30.3 Update Interface Support Matrix and Public Blocker Docs | backlog | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/30-3-update-interface-support-matrix.md` |

## Epic 31: Provider Completeness, Positioning, and Migration

Goal: make this provider complete enough to be the default provider choice for a given appliance, then convert that completeness into user trust and adoption.

| Story | Status | File |
|---|---|---|
| 31.0 Complete Provider Coverage Audit | backlog | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/31-0-complete-provider-coverage-audit.md` |
| 31.1 Complete Provider Positioning README and Registry Pass | backlog | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/31-1-complete-provider-positioning-docs.md` |
| 31.2 Existing Provider Migration Guide | backlog | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/31-2-existing-provider-migration-guide.md` |
| 31.3 Example Stacks for Adoption | backlog | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/31-3-example-stacks-for-adoption.md` |

## Epic 32: Release Credibility and v1 Readiness

Goal: make releases feel intentionally tested, versioned, and ready for production adoption.

| Story | Status | File |
|---|---|---|
| 32.1 Acceptance Test Proof Artifact | backlog | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/32-1-acceptance-test-proof-artifact.md` |
| 32.2 Provider Preflight and Version Diagnostics | backlog | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/32-2-provider-preflight-version-diagnostics.md` |
| 32.3 v1 Stability Roadmap | backlog | `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/32-3-v1-stability-roadmap.md` |

## Recommended Sequence

1. Treat Epics 25B through 29 as completed or historical unless a regression appears.
2. Start with Story 30.1 so release timing and support-matrix language are evidence-backed.
3. Use Story 30.2 to prototype against OPNsense `master` or snapshot only; do not declare stable support until Story 30.1 finds a released OPNsense version.
4. Run Story 30.3 before or alongside implementation so public docs stop describing the interface API as a generic old blocker.
5. Run Story 31.0 before migration-positioning work so coverage gaps are audited as product completeness work, not buried in docs.
6. Follow with Stories 31.1 and 31.2 to make the Registry/README story match the provider's actual coverage advantage.
7. Add Story 32.1 acceptance proof before treating v1 positioning as credible.
